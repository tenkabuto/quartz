Release valve for [[My Notes]] that don't need to be private

## hosting 
[[pgs.sh static hosting]]

<https://libera.chat/guides/registration> IRC for enrolling in closed beta for <https://pgs.sh/>

Static site hosting: <https://pgs.sh/>
- Able to share same SSH key across both laptop and Steam Deck? So I can update sites from both?
	- Technically yes, I think, but I have setup separate ones for each device

## vs. blogs
I think that blogs are kinda boring, but it's rough that personal sites that mingle a general website and blog are kinda left to the wayside without a sort of syndication format of their own.

## Other sites
