* As a long time consumer of sites like these, I think the first half of the video touches on that lots of content in this space is pretty vapid, lacking substance and has no ability to really be checked for whether the proposed ideas really work or are working. (And I think lots of site owners benefit from this by placing the burden of achieving the desired outcome on the reader/consumer when in fact the site owner's ideas suck / are poorly substantiated.)
