Hello and welcome to the website for Brandon Perez-Hall, a Christian, husband, philosopher, and amateur economist. [[About|For more info about him, see here.]]

On this website I try to refine my thinking about a variety of topics, collect content that I post elsewhere (and put it in a more reader-friendly and structured format), and share things in case others may benefit from them.

I recommend checking out the [[Projects|Projects]] page to see some of the more substantial things that I've made.

To see what I've been up to and focusing on lately, see the [[Now]] page.

Content can also be found via the [[tags/_index|Tags Index]], which uses the tags assigned to each post to kind of categorize them for easier finding and navigating.

## Need to contact me?

## Big Recommend: Favorite Video Ever
Below is one of my favorite videos ever, preserved so that I may share it with my favorite people, including you. But how can that be? We've never met! Indeed, we haven't, but wouldn't that be nice? "No, it wouldn't!", you might say. And you know, you might be right.

It's a lecture by Leo Buscaglia that delves into the nature of being human, all the weirdness and wonderfulness that being human entails, and how we can bond and get along better by recognizing that humanness in ourselves and each other and laughing about it, together.
