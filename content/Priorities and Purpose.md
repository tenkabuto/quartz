It'd be nice to find a community of people trying to live the deep life/priorities-first. Disciplined and purposeful, as one without the other sucks. This would be similar to [[Priorities and Purpose#Deep Life|the Deep Life thing]].

I really want to hear more about how people do/should prioritize things, determine what's important for themselves.

Though honestly, persons who actually do such things might be less inclined to participate in a community of people that talk about doing it.

## Relevant Habits
Be intentional/deliberate about what videos and podcasts you listen to

## Deep Life
Concept from Cal Newport. Kinda like living in alignment with what you value and your principles.

Question of how to prioritize tasks: <https://www.reddit.com/r/thedeeplife/comments/jwjc6p/how_do_you_prioritize_your_tasks/>,> talks about Configure (below) being the hardest part for them.

> Three requirements of time management
> - Capture: don't store anything in your head. Your ideas, info, commitments, plans.
> - Configure: make effort organizing. Gather relevant info in one place.
> - Control: proactively make a plan for your time in advance: quarterly, weekly, daily
> - Constrain (bonus!): figure out how to automate, consolidate interruptions with office hours
