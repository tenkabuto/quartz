Reading [[Python Crash Course]], hopefully including [[../For Private/People/Austin|Austin]] and maybe looping in [[../For Private/People/Christian Perez|Christian Perez]]

Read [this book, *Serious Python*](https://nostarch.com/seriouspython), after *Python Crash Course*

Look into generating documentation from docstrings - this would be a good habit to have early on
- <https://pdoc.dev/>
- <https://pypi.org/project/pdoc/>
- <https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html#what-is-pdoc>

Using autoformatters in VS Code: <https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0>
- It was a more complicated process; required enabling format on save, trying it, and being prompted by VS Code to change from autopep8 to black.
