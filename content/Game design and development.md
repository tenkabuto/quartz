## To be integrated
Make a game where you need to guess the letters in a hidden word. For each letter you guess, you get a point. You can trade one point to reveal a letter, but it swaps out the current word for a longer word that has one more letter on it. If you complete the word, you get to keep your remaining points. Mostly just seeing how long you can last and if the player ends up bargaining a lot.
