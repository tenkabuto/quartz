### Game Room reservation
Great Escape Games: "Hello, the prices for our 2 Private rooms is $15 for the day. Our big private Party Room is $50 per hour (negotiable). Our entire store has access to the WiFi. And all private rooms have outlets."
- For how many people fit comfortably in each room: "Depends on the season. Since it's an enclosed space it gets warm. There's space for 8 to sit comfortably, but might get a bit stuffy. 6 is usually fine."

Considering going there for in-person digital MTG play; low priority for me, though
