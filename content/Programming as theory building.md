Inspired by post ["Theory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies"](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/) by Baldur, which was itself inspired by the paper ["Programming as Theory Building"](https://pablo.rauzy.name/dev/naur1985programming.pdf)Â (Peter Naur, 1985; which was somewhat ironically, somewhat fittingly difficult to understand without reading other people's interpretations of it)
