title: Writing about experiences
---

I think it's important for people to record and discuss how they feeling at different stages of development and familiarity with a thing, especially for endeavors that others may undertake, either ones that are exactly the same (like a linear video game, watching a movie or reading a story) or one that's just similar in kind (learning a programming language, navigating relationship). Likely more helpful/useful for audience in latter case for them to hear your thoughts, as both when you're uncertain it feels better when you have company and it can be nice to know that you've gotten past the point that they are concerned about now.

Accordingly, it is very useful to sign post what stage of development or progression your written or shared experience is at, for it helps people find experiences that will resonate with them.

Backstory: I was prompted to think about this by thinking about [[notes/Time budgeting|budgeting time]] for various activities that I'd do with Ryan, such as playing [[Baldur's Gate 3|BG3]] soon and, for the future, anticipating that I'll need to budgeting for brewing beer with Ryan (and that the process will carry with it stress and anxiety for me/us until we've figured it out).
