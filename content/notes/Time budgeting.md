Aspire to compose a personal theory and practice of time budgeting, one which others may learn from

Log your time to record not just your plan of action but also how you actually acted.

# Prioritization
Schedule first the tasks you'd be disappointed to have not done if you die (your time resource runs out).

If you make sure to budget time for the big, important things and you do work on them, and if they're discrete things, over time you'll be without those big, important projects - assuming they aren't replaced with other, big and important projects.

Kernels (seeds) of future projects and endeavors, sown now in some way? Either by allocating a small amount of time to them now and ramping up later or, in this moment, just mindfully budgeting that later time for them so that you may not worry about it any longer.

# External thinking on this
Many of the articles I've found about it have been by various time keeping services/tools, which are to be used for billing by persons that work flexible hours. They don't go deep into the why (user philosophy) and how (user methodology), especially not to the degree that YNAB does with their many resources.

This article is very into the why of time budgeting, motivating the practice. Not a ton into the how, but it's still nice: <https://www.timecamp.com/blog/2023/02/time-budgeting/>

# Motivated/inspired by
Using YNAB for [[notes/Financial budgeting|financial budgeting]] has been pretty revolutionary for me so far. It allows me to put money towards goals out in the future by using categories (it might be nice to add some way of having discrete goals, ones that aren't carried forward as categories for all time periods that it hasn't been assigned to (this might be one reason they have "hidden" categories, though, for you to hide categories that aren't usually relevant to your concerns --- but I imagine it'd be helpful to set reminders for your hidden categories)).

From that experience, I've wondered how I may do a similar thing with my time, helping me focus more on the things that I'd like to treat as priorities in my life rather than just reacting to whatever pops up and hope that I address those important things.

Live, with some work sprinkled in. As opposed to working to live, which is in response to "live to work"
