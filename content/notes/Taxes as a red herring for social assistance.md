title: Taxes as a red herring for social assistance
---


"I have contributed already to my fellow man by paying my taxes. [I have done my part.] Why need I care yet more?"

We are somewhat discouraged from making voluntary contributions to assistance programs, as we're already paying some amount in taxes, which is non-negotiable, so we'd need to pay an additional amount voluntarily.

However, this isn't exactly a bad thing, as we might in truth be willing to donate a greater sum to social welfare programs than the non-negotiable amount. We'd just need to think about that and choose what causes we'd want to contribute them to.

## Idea: Social assistance voucher system
If only there was essentially a tax payer voucher system for social welfare. Tax-wise the funds are primarily *slated* to be allocated towards cause X, but each citizen may elect to reallocate their funds to cause Y. This goes along with seeing social welfare programs as both charity for others and personal insurance.
- To elaborate: taxes towards social assistance would still be some non-negotiable % or fixed amount, but each tax payer is able to choose what programs receives their money. It's like forced [[notes/Financial budgeting|budgeting]].
