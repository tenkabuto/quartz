# And homelessness ([[notes/Houselessness|houselessness]])
## Project idea - "Homes of the homeless"
Interviewing currently homeless and ex-homeless persons about their concept of home, what it means to them, if it's bound to housing that's theirs or if they had a sense of it while living unhoused.

Photos and interviews with the homeless about their attempts to make their spots homey/homely. Help humanize them, connect us with them.

- Similar to book that dad told me about that featured images of people's living spaces that aren't cleaned up, so we can capture the daily appearance of a place that's lived in.
- In order to do this, try to place an ad towards the homeless community asking them for an invitation to interview them and photograph their living space. Don't want to just walk up on them and interrupt them unexpectedly - it'd be rude towards them and likely unsafe for me.
