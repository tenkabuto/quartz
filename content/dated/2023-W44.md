## Human experience when sick
The human experience thing of that when you're sick you get uncharacteristically motivated and driven to do things, with an irrational level of confidence, such as to work out, clean or reorganize the house, skateboard intensely
- it's like your body is messing with your head, reminding you of all the cool stuff you'll hopefully get to do once it gets better

Go thru RR's Shred School list of tricks, use them for gathering skate data
Intro: <https://youtu.be/WVni8TzQjpY?si=Xi0KkhH-oJanPjMQ>
- I like that in his intro to the series he mentions towards the end that because I'm watching it, that means that the first video in the series is available! Great idea, releasing them at the same time. Then he mentions he'll release the others weekly. He also set expectations for how many videos will ultimately be released in the series
- one missed opportunity that I see here is that he didn't actually link to the playlist in his video's description, he only added an embedded link to the playlist at the end of the video (via an end card). He should do both.
- also, he should likely have setup a newsletter and linked to it in the video description.
<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPvezvbiPZ7CQW5Pikhw9bQegPV6nZLdZ&si=XbKHSxpO_If57CNl>
- note that I could also use the skate stats to generate pre and post stats, from prior to doing the skate school and after.
	- not sure how to handle probability for tricks that I will never land or always land

Anki spaced repetition for skating tricks, reminding you to do and try certain tricks that you haven't tried in a while.

"Sustainable" rates of viewership on YouTube given natural low levels, excepting periodic spikes, for monetization viability
- passive, organic watch time

> Organic growth on YouTube refers to the process of increasing your channel's viewership and subscribers without paying for ads. This can be done by creating and sharing high-quality content, using relevant keywords, and engaging with other users on the platform. <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-youtube-organic-growth-how-work-gobinda-chandra-paul>

- I feel like some of this can still be too algorithm driven and algorithm reliant if it strongly leans on recommendations.
- inbounds and views from subscribers are likely the more reliable stats to think about, rather than from browse features and recommendations.
- browse features, might be listed differently from recommendations even though both involve a degree of recommendation: <https://blog.audiencegrowers.com/browse-features-youtube-analytics/#:~:text=Browse%20Features%20is%20the%20traffic,your%20videos%20to%20potential%20viewers>.
	- <https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/twas3w/difference_between_suggested_videos_and_browse/> difference explained

On YouTube post videos as that they're "out of context", in that they're more intended to be viewed in context of something else - like seeing it embedded in or linked to from an article. This would let you worry less about needing to rehash all the context per video, which is quite time consuming to do versus just writing it up. Plus it doesn't really help when the information isn't visual (keeping with the idea of only using video for visually enriching the information and understandings that you wish to convey).
- honestly, more often than not video content on YouTube will be presented outside of a strictly relevant context (even when videos are suggested/recommended by the algorithm because of seemingly related keywords, it'll likely be missing out on context (or have some degree of mismatch) that'd need to be provided manually via a link or full rehashing of the required context)
- I'd rather rehash context in text, as, at least there, it can be parsed by the audience quickly and I can reuse and move it around quickly and easily (without terribly advanced tools).

Obsidian rss plugin for automatically updating notes with lists of recent posts from relevant content sources you'd like to share with others
- this doesn't put the items into a single article, but this seems like the best option for now: <https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-rss>

The Professor's suggestion that YouTube itself is a major enemy of YouTube creators and that viewers who support the creators can fight back with simple things, such as liking, commenting, and subscribing; sharing your favorite content with your friends; when you discover a new channel and like one piece of their content, browse their archive of videos, look at what else they've offered in the past;
<https://youtu.be/IXvwSpigljE?si=TzT8R9GpBI8TckNI>
- YT will not send notifications to the vast majority of his subscribers when he posts a video, the algorithm is too choosy about what it notifies people about
- I forgot about these concerns
- very similar to the short time window of success with traditional publishing, the Prof suggests that the algorithm only gives content a chance within about the first week or so after publication, recommending it to people; after that time, if the content didn't perform well, it neglects it. (Not too certain if it genuinely does this (it'd be good to know how frequently it reconsiders content item quality), but it is a big concern for creators and would-be consumers as well)

Make a video as long as it needs to be — no more and no less. Respect your audience's time.

Attention conversation notice

Separate YT channels decreases the likelihood of any one channel being monetized and being sustainably monetizable, since for each ypp channel you need to upload 3 videos per 90 day period, it's unlikely you'll be able to or want to update all the various channels that frequently

I might want to develop a focus market, for people with lots of interests and ideas and who need help with focusing on them and making something of them. Like this guy: <https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallYTChannel/comments/17mbhs0/i_like_to_many_things/>

> Taking flight from a real geography and an event that occurred in the context of wars or conquests, the historical legend comes to us crossing the centuries on the wings of traditional oral history. Through this narration of supernatural, natural events, or an amalgamation of both, the cosmogony of the town in which said story arises becomes visible. Such is the vibrant contribution of “Mexican Historical Legends” (1899) by Heriberto Frías (1870-1925), prestigious writer, journalist and politician. Brief narratives, myths and legends of pre-Hispanic Mexico, in the words of its author, in these pages we will find: "the most beautiful episodes and the most curious customs of the first races that inhabited the soil of my country, episodes and customs known only to wise men and archaeologists.” (Introduction by Dulcamara.)

It'd be cool to make beginner level cubes that only use Premodern cards (or from any non-rotating, static format)

vintage cube draft <https://youtu.be/UKCO11HEOak?si=88AQtkjqtOCaazgW>

Battle box, budget format recommended by podcast I linked to: <https://youtu.be/_3K75KYFoAk?si=zqQP9SNk7lr3-Pya>

Representative cube for premodern - treat ever card in the format as a separate person in population (singleton), distill down to common keywords and spell types. Unlimited mana, so likely played as a format with mana provided, like the battle box.
- interesting statistical challenge - deciding on a card based on its characteristics and not necessarily its strategic value
- depending on how large the end cube will be permitted to be (end sample size desired) and how we wish to have it play (if like battle box, will be more combat-forward), would have differing levels of count cutoffs - as in a 100 end sample size, 1 card per 1% of population. Then there's a balancing act between selecting one card over another in order to better match and fulfill demographic quotas for representation.
- operationally: filter down to unique cards in format, get characteristics of those cards for further analysis and count by num of unique cards.

## Priorities
Remind yourself to love the process, not the destination

Trying to be more happy with how I'm using my time, putting it towards things I care about more than other things - choosing these things over those things

This evening, plan out things for the rest of the week so that I won't need to worry about the morning of, as I did this morning. Should likely just need to review my plans in the morning.

## Writing
### Unexplained Plot Elements and Mystery/Horror
Below material was prompted by a dream about a movie with lots of WTF imagery that's loosely explained here and there but ultimately was unexplained.

Movies that don't explain why or how a strange thing is happening.
- I heard that in Japanese cinema they're more tolerant of generally mysterious things like that, where the stuff just happens and humans are stuck dealing with it/experiencing it and never quite understanding it or getting to control it.
- token understandings to appease the mind of the audience and let them feel like they're piecing the mystery together, when in fact the mystery isn't actually resolved and the things they do piece together just fit together enough to advance and deepen the mystery. Giving the sense of a logical progression and puzzle forming when in fact it's a giant and unresolved mystery that teases the audience into thinking they can resolve it.

Lovecraftian type of mystery, like cosmic horror and awe, Eldritch horrors
- cosmic horror: <https://collider.com/best-cosmic-horror-movies/>
- cosmic awe? (Other side of the coin)
	- awe at cosmic scales of things: <https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/26/cosmic-awe>
	- "Scholars across disciplines have long sought to understand the stirring – soul searching, even – emotions the universe evokes. Some have described a shakiness they call “cosmic vertigo.” Others have used the term “cosmic insignificance” when confronted with one’s littleness in a limitless universe. A few have found dwelling too long on such thoughts to be anxiety-inducing, an experience they label “neuroexistentialism.”" <https://news.stanford.edu/2022/09/06/power-awe-cosmos/>
	- neuroexistentialism: <https://qz.com/1531721/feeling-anxious-its-not-just-you-its-our-philosophical-era-of-neuroexistentialism>
	- of awe at lovecraftian horror: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/1502xe3/comment/js2a2gl/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3>
- uncertainty and the unexplained; indifferent yet paternalistic

Cozy Cosmos would be the far other end of Lovecraft horror — comforting side of uncertainty and lack of control

Other worlds, other Gods — cosmic horror as a way of, in contrast, helping better appreciate our world and our God, the Christian God

If you let it sink into your mind that you don't have to explain everything, your brain can ramp up its creativity and imagination.

## Website and web

I love stumbling across things that remind me about the free web culture and how great it is. I was prompted to this by this site: <https://web.archive.org/web/20231031004749/http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html>

## Notes
First and foremost my notes are for me. Might want to make a diff site for when primarily serving others, but *shrug*. The serving-others orientation is always there, since I'm ultimately posting where others may benefit, but it's less important and prominent.

Continue to compile notes from prior week into that week's note - then move over to public or private as fits

## OneNote Wants
OneNote, it'd be great if we could hide "completed tasks"

## Obsidian
Might need something in Obsidian like super charged links but for bulleted lists, to denote status and visual language - like I do in OneNote at work

## Own definitions
Formulating your own definitions of words, understanding what concepts you're using and working with. Be clear to yourself. If you can't understand what you yourself mean, how might any one else? And indeed, if you have no clear idea of what you mean, you have no clear way to judge whether another person means something the same way that you do. — issue is addressing the potential for even subtle conflicts of meaning, between yourself and others, and also between yourself now and yourself of 5 minutes ago.

## Saintly Love
Notion that "you don't love me — you don't know anything about me, so you can't love me."
- For the Saints, I suspect that we may freely say that because Jesus loved and loves you, we will work to love you, too.

## Econ
Income elasticity of demand deals with entire shifts of the demand curve, whereas regular elasticity of demand just relates to the shape of the demand curve itself: <https://youtu.be/Izst4lSg6Ag?si=ksthyU7UeM5OPl-O>

### Work scheduling
For jobs that are hours based, like a full-time job, we should be able to proportionally scale back our hours for a proportional change in gross pay. It's lame that there's such rigidity and discontinuity.
I should be able to reduce my hours worked by 1 hour per day (5 hours less per week, for a 1/8th decrease from 40 hours), especially if I plan this out formally. It's the uncertain/unexpected unavailability that's a key issue, but formal declarations of such hours would mitigate that to a great degree.

This differs from flexible work schedules, which I've tended to hear about in terms of how a conventional block of work hours is allocated in one's day.
Instead it's dealing with unconventional amounts of work hours.

## Plumming Fix
Who to call to fix a dripping sink?
- Plummer

	- I've done steps 1&2 so far. Can proceed with step 3+ after cleaning out the area under the sink

- [ ] ⭐ Following [this video](https://youtu.be/SYPFon69vKs?si=Fw_TTjUAPvPgk9aP), the next step that I need to do is get a new "cartridge", which would be like the old one that I extracted. I'd then install it.

## Tech wants
I'm surprised there's no sort of workspace and window tiling saving, like you can in one click launch all the relevant apps and tile them the same way. - Windows 10+

## Wisdom Twist
They say that you don't realize what you had until you've lost it. I'd say a related idea: you don't quite realize what you've had until you've experienced an alternative. This can be thought of as a more general form of the earlier phrase, but it also works better than it, especially as it can apply in a mutually positive way.

The former says that one state (having) is/was good and the other state (not having) is/was bad.

But the latter can be mutually positive. For instance, when you only knew your own ways of operating, you likely took them for granted and didn't appreciate them much. But once you saw how other people operate (also in a good way, despite being different), you then view how you operate in a different light. You can compare and consider aspects of your experience and behavior in ways that you likely wouldn't have done before.

## Looking into presidential candidates
Trump, Biden, and DeSantis are non-options for me. After looking at [the current lineup of candidates](https://apnews.com/article/2024-president-election-suarez-debate-candidates-39724fcef68d16b410bb5dd3ca42f809) (currently last updated as of Oct 28, 2023), I was only interested in Tim Scott, Doug Burgam, and Marianne Williamson (remembering her from prior campaign cycles). I eliminated the last two after looking more into each of the three candidates, leaving me rather hopefully with Tim Scott.

I'm liking Tim Scott as a GOP candidate, rival to Trump and DeSantis; he's optimistic and effective: <https://apnews.com/article/tim-scott-2024-presidential-race-4a73e00db2295afbc4b07d1c6bb64811>

Lmao given the way this is written, this sounds really funny and whiny ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/marianne-williamson-president-2024-biden-democratic-primary-14e59754bed9e0c54dad4fdfbbc1fa6b)):

> Striking a defiant tone Saturday, Williamson denounced “those who feel they are the adults in the room” and aren’t taking her candidacy seriously, proclaiming, “Let me in there.”
