## ðŸŸ© [[../Writing|Writing]]

The human mind is not always straightforward and consistent, especially with regards to dispositions, intents, wants, and needs. In stories, reflecting this variance gives the character a realism. Whereas if they are portrayed as being single minded and having no wavering of thought, they'll likely be thought to be poorly developed, flat, and unrealistic. I imagine this happens a lot for historical depictions based on few accounts, especially if/when those accounts all suggest the same thing.

Economic profits are different from accounting profits. I think they're where a supplier is able to charge a higher price than the efficient/equilibrium market price.
- Looking into it, it seems to be accounting profit less opportunity costs.
	- How to actually use this idea, though?
	- <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics>)
		- I forget, why is the marginal revenue curve steeper then the demand curve for noncompetitive markets?
		- Is it wrong for a firm to be in favor of the market and eroding economic profit by increased competition? It seems like it'd be beneficial for society in general (marginal net benefit social).
			- why would it be weird for them to do this? I think this is relates to my idea of [Twig-onomics, the market martyrs](https://youtu.be/w1Ue4RdowmU).

Marginal net social benefits - the deep end of economics

### ðŸŸ© [[../Economics#Market life cycle|Market life cycle in Economics]]
If you're developing a new market, in the way of customer development, you might start off doing things that are pro-market (facilitation). But once the market is developed enough to sustain you, you might be tempted to enclose the market, raising barriers to other entrants. At this point you'd likely try to erase what you might've done or said in the beginning, from your [[../Market development]] steps, as they contradict what you are trying to do, then. You've become anti-market. (Shift in firm strategy depending on the life stage of the/a market they're trying to succeed within.)

Make a game where you need to guess the letters in a hidden word. For each letter you guess, you get a point. You can trade one point to reveal a letter, but it swaps out the current word for a longer word that has one more letter on it. If you complete the word, you get to keep your remaining points. Mostly just seeing how long you can last and if the player ends up bargaining a lot.
