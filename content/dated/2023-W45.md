Determining passive, baseline views and watch time to estimate when you might need to worry about monetization
Likely use lowest traffic hours, multipled up to a full year to see if you'll have the required 4000 watch hours
Also determine baseline subscriber growth to determine possible passive attainment of 1000 subscribers for YPP

YT rss feed, any clue that person clicked in to a video via rss? Are video links tracked in Studio?

One thing that's funny to me is that many big YouTube channels actually fail to implement things that would likely make themselves even more successful, like simply linking to relevant playlists in their video descriptions to drive traffic to videos their viewers would likely be interested in. They're successful despite these things, leaving additional success on the table.
- Don't just copy big channels, as many of them don't fully do optimal things.

Market of people with many interests! ‚≠ê

Market of people with many interests and ideas, but who'd benefit a lot from focusing on a tight set of interests and aspirations for a while. Prioritizing things, among people with lots of things they want to do.

Seems like kind of a low aspiration, but I think I'd like to become a professional content creator

Suspect that the economy will contract pretty soon, so can think about making content oriented around that

### üü© [[../Writing#üü© Peak From a dream the early morning of 11/6/23|Peak: From a dream the early morning of 11/6/23]]
Space station hijacked and brought back to earth, crashing in metropolitan area. People who came in contact with the crash items start developing strange growths, seeable on X-ray scans, etc. Green growths.

Peak - selling it to the public as that you're becoming better, enhanced, when in reality it's a live experimentation, using willing guinea pigs. Notion is that you'll never know your peak until you go through this; it'll get you there, to your highest level of performance and health.

People wearing woven patches on their head or on their back. Usually the patches have some white showing, other times green specks among the white, other times full green to light green (like it's dried out)

It's like a mix between mold and moss. The people are getting transformed into people whose systems are actively being hijacked by a space parasite. The effects of it aren't too clear, but more advanced cases seem to mostly disintegrate.

Saw pretty much a mound of moss that was a person. Saw a proud parent, wearijg a path, pushing a stroller with a fully green baby.

Saw a person's face, scaled up in size and all but sewn into a wall - though it was not green, the skin seemed weirdly taut and cracking. This is one of the early strains, a way they manifest, but it seems to move slower than the general green one and thus is less prominent. (Multi strain, multi effect)
- these wall forms are horrifying to behold.
- their existence is a major surprise, as they're quite shocking. But the reason they're a surprise is that when the people were initially infected with this strain, it overtook them very quickly and completely. But it can't spread easily and it can't be mobile, so it can't go around spreading itself out. (Immediate contact only, no spores)

Somewhat common to see people with the eye infections squinting the affected eye and moving it around to (actually) regain use of it, but for them it just restores a feeling of confidence that they can move it around and that it's working correctly.

In a lot of ways this feels like the Expanse books with the protomolecule and how the firm is testing it on people. But they didn't do open trials and try to sell it to the public. Also with this the effects aren't fully revealed. This is all from a dream so it's unclear what it's inspired by, if anything.
### üü© [[../Writing#God Magic|God Magic]]
Some magic is much more plausible than others. God more readily uses things that are likely to escape notice, such as little things, slow things, invisible things (the wind), etc. This is not to say that he doesn't use other things and that he doesn't use things when it's likely that they'll be noticed.

In fact, some of the best known stories are those about occasions where God just went for it while everyone was watching.

But what I was getting at was that he tends to use the lesser noticed things. Mushrooms, for instance. If a person is having a bad day and suddenly they see a pretty little mushroom, they might feel better. And God likes that, so he sets those sorts of things up. He also likes, in that situation, a little bit of trickery that escapes the person's attention. Yes, they might start to wonder about if they'd seen the mushroom in that spot once before. They're pretty sure it wasn't there the day before. And they "know" that mushrooms grow slowly, so they assume that it might have popped out of the ground sometime between yesterday, when they saw that the ground was bare, and today, when they see the little one. And with this, they feel extra contented. Little do they know, however, is that this was no conventional mushroom. Well, it is a regular mushroom, but it's a regular one *used* in an irregular way: with God's help, it formed only seconds prior to the vision of a mushroom appearing in the person's peripheral vision. They'll never know it, but he will.

God as a reality warper and weaver

Magic and miracles are violations of conventional reality. Not in terms of just how humans have conceived of reality, but, well, who's to say that God truly doesn't just make exceptions sometimes?

Magical realism, speculative nonfiction, fantasy

## üü© [[../Music Capture#Dream Music|Music Capture & Dream music]]
Producing songs that dial up their tempo, starting out slower with a beat but push it faster and faster to see how it goes on different time scales (beat scales?). Up and down in tempo, playing with that, possibly layering in other sounds that also change in tempo.
- stretching out time scales and shrinking them down - either just affecting time between the hitting of regular keys or affecting their sound, too, with the latter like you're stretching out a rasterized image of the music whereas with the former it's just putting more space between separate images
- time warping in music design - playing with sound and music

Don't worry about "the right way" of capturing the music and working on it and playing with it the right way. Just go for it, have fun, explore the space.

### Game Room reservation
Great Escape Games: "Hello, the prices for our 2 Private rooms is $15 for the day. Our big private Party Room is $50 per hour (negotiable). Our entire store has access to the WiFi. And all private rooms have outlets."
- For how many people fit comfortably in each room: "Depends on the season. Since it's an enclosed space it gets warm. There's space for 8 to sit comfortably, but might get a bit stuffy. 6 is usually fine."

Considering going there for in-person digital MTG play; low priority for me, though

## üü© [[Wisdom]]
It isn't a uniquely Christian idea that you can be the source of your own demise, but I think it is more prominent in the texts (not current culture, unfortunately)

I have a habit of putting myself in other people's shoes. If I hear someone speaking against the actions and thoughts of someone else, I lapse into imagining myself doing or thinking those same things and what would compel me to do so. Whereas other people just flatly laugh and mock.
- Never forget that you can be the bad guy, even (or especially) when you think otherwise.
