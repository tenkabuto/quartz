"Life making" for making a life together, in the way of home making is for making a home and sense of home. This might relate to the concept of lifestyle design, though I think that is usually interpreted mainly in a personal manner - less so for a couple jointly. But my experience may just be skewed by long exposure to self-help and personal development stuff, or, at the time (in the past), lack of personal relevance of wisdom that's for a relationship context.
