Admittedly I've been slacking on this. I kinda don't want to do the exercises in Duolingo. I think it feels a bit too isolated and artificial. I wish that I could learn and chat in a more natural context, such as a brewery or taproom.

This audiobook for listening to Spanish, even though I don't know quite what's being said: <https://librivox.org/leyendas-historicas-mexicanas-by-heriberto-frias/> Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales, Short Stories

> Taking flight from a real geography and an event that occurred in the context of wars or conquests, the historical legend comes to us crossing the centuries on the wings of traditional oral history. Through this narration of supernatural, natural events, or an amalgamation of both, the cosmogony of the town in which said story arises becomes visible. Such is the vibrant contribution of “Mexican Historical Legends” (1899) by Heriberto Frías (1870-1925), prestigious writer, journalist and politician. Brief narratives, myths and legends of pre-Hispanic Mexico, in the words of its author, in these pages we will find: "the most beautiful episodes and the most curious customs of the first races that inhabited the soil of my country, episodes and customs known only to wise men and archaeologists.” (Introduction by Dulcamara.)
