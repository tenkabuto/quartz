## Onion/Sausage Soup
### How Mom described Grandma making it:

>She didn't peel potatoes first; boil them then set aside when they get soft. Peel after boiled, cut into bite sized chunks.
>
>Use smoked sausage. Boil it for approx an hour after cutting it in half --- Bring it to a rapid boil then simmer for half an hour.
>
>Use Crisco --- for us, olive oil
>Chop onion, brown it in oil until translucent
>Add flour to make a rou sauce (thickening agent for soup)
>
>Water from sausage is broth, add it to the soup/sauce
>
> Add potatoes
> 
> At end, add buttermilk (1 cup or so) and sour cream. Do not let it boil.
> 
> Cut sausage into bite-sized chunks.
> Include many potatoes.

### How I'll do it:
(Using the pressure cooker)

Cut a number of potatoes (5?) into bite-sized chunks.

Chop onion, use pressure cooker to brown the onion in olive oil until translucent.

Add water (4 cups or so, not too much to avoid overwatering).
Add sausage.
Add potatoes.
Pressure cook for X amount of time
- [ ] Check time on time sheet

After that's done, add butter milk and sour cream.
- Two cups of buttermilk wasn't enough for sour flavor. Add three or four - I've been adding some directly to my bowl in addition to the original 2 cups that were mixed in. I haven't used much sour cream, but it didn't seem to add much flavor.

I might include chicken broth next time, as I keep needing to add salt to bring out the flavor.
