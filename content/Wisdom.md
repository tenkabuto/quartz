## To be integrated
It isn't a uniquely Christian idea that you can be the source of your own demise, but I think it is more prominent in the texts (not current culture, unfortunately)

I have a habit of putting myself in other people's shoes. If I hear someone speaking against the actions and thoughts of someone else, I lapse into imagining myself doing or thinking those same things and what would compel me to do so. Whereas other people just flatly laugh and mock.
- Never forget that you can be the bad guy, even (or especially) when you think otherwise.
