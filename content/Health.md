## Healthy Eating
Thinking about foods to eat in [[Cooking]] - not all of which would be healthy, admittedly

Hopefully settle on foods that are GERD friendly, don't prompt acid reflux

## Exercises
Kettlebell exercises, workouts
Exercise ball exercises, workouts

Some are also in [[Skateboarding#Prep]]

### Illness / Recovery
