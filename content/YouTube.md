## YouTube Monetization Requirements

> Before you can join the YPP, you need to accomplish a few milestones first.
> 
> If you want to make money through fan funding, such as Super Chats, Super Thanks, channel memberships, and more, here are the minimum requirements to join the YPP:
> 
> - 500 subscribers
> - Three public uploads in the last 90 days
> - 3,000 public watch hours in the previous 12 months or 3 million public YouTube Shorts views in the last 90 days.
> 
> If you want to make money with video advertisements, here are the minimum requirements do that:
> 
> - 1,000 subscribers
> - 4,000 hours of public watch time within a 12-month period or 10 million public YouTube Shorts views within a 90-day period.


## Schedule to stay monetized
Post one video every 30 days, to keep up with monetization requirement of 3 video uploads in 90 days
- Technically this only matters once you're eligible for YT monetization; you could try to "time" it right, by forecasting out how long it'll take at current rates, but eh.
- Kinda lazier and less stressful (due to uncertainty) to go for the assumption that growth will just organically grow at the same rate. (Unprompted by more uploads, that is - like if your current rate is skewed by a recent upload driving more interest and activity. Using a rate from a period of inactivity might be more helpful.)

## To be integrated
Much of the following relates to [[Content Creation]]

"Sustainable" rates of viewership on YouTube given natural low levels, excepting periodic spikes, for monetization viability
- passive, organic watch time

> Organic growth on YouTube refers to the process of increasing your channel's viewership and subscribers without paying for ads. This can be done by creating and sharing high-quality content, using relevant keywords, and engaging with other users on the platform. <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-youtube-organic-growth-how-work-gobinda-chandra-paul>

- I feel like some of this can still be too algorithm driven and algorithm reliant if it strongly leans on recommendations.
- inbounds and views from subscribers are likely the more reliable stats to think about, rather than from browse features and recommendations.
- browse features, might be listed differently from recommendations even though both involve a degree of recommendation: <https://blog.audiencegrowers.com/browse-features-youtube-analytics/#:~:text=Browse%20Features%20is%20the%20traffic,your%20videos%20to%20potential%20viewers>.
	- <https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/twas3w/difference_between_suggested_videos_and_browse/> difference explained

On YouTube post videos as that they're "out of context", in that they're more intended to be viewed in context of something else - like seeing it embedded in or linked to from an article. This would let you worry less about needing to rehash all the context per video, which is quite time consuming to do versus just writing it up. Plus it doesn't really help when the information isn't visual (keeping with the idea of only using video for visually enriching the information and understandings that you wish to convey).
- honestly, more often than not video content on YouTube will be presented outside of a strictly relevant context (even when videos are suggested/recommended by the algorithm because of seemingly related keywords, it'll likely be missing out on context (or have some degree of mismatch) that'd need to be provided manually via a link or full rehashing of the required context)
- I'd rather rehash context in text, as, at least there, it can be parsed by the audience quickly and I can reuse and move it around quickly and easily (without terribly advanced tools).

Determining passive, baseline views and watch time to estimate when you might need to worry about monetization
Likely use lowest traffic hours, multipled up to a full year to see if you'll have the required 4000 watch hours
Also determine baseline subscriber growth to determine possible passive attainment of 1000 subscribers for YPP

Generally, people don't come to the show to see you perform. They come for the experience, the performance. You're a footnote. <https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/17r27na/comment/k8hhnip/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3>

YT rss feed, any clue that person clicked in to a video via rss? Are video links tracked in Studio?

One thing that's funny to me is that many big YouTube channels actually fail to implement things that would likely make themselves even more successful, like simply linking to relevant playlists in their video descriptions to drive traffic to videos their viewers would likely be interested in. They're successful despite these things, leaving additional success on the table.
- Don't just copy big channels, as many of them don't fully do optimal things.
