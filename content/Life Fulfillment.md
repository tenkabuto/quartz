I am not remembering what it was that I was listening to that was hyping me up for not seeking fulfillment through my job. It wasn't the recent book about 4K Weeks, it was something else.[^date-1]

Luke Smith helped, but it wasn't just him.[^smithy] Cal Newport and the Deep Life stuff also helped.

I'd like to pin down more what Cal Newport means by living the Deep Life, so I can better evaluate if it's something I'd like to do. It feels similar to what I'd like and some of its motivation resonates with me, but idk yet.

[^smithy]: Get link to his video about being separate from your work; saved in YouTube World View playlist, he mentions that Apostle Paul was known for way different things than his occupation
