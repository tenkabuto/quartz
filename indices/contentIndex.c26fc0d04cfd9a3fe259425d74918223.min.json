Taleb would no doubt ask me, worriedly, \"are you deaf?\", if I did not state that the lead aphorism isn't necessarily true, as his whole investment strategy, as he outlined it in _Fooled_, ran quite contrary to it.\n\nI have thought about such primarily with regards to the fact that most people are, currently, paid only once or twice a month. If, in addition to this, the possibility that I suggested in the previous paragraph was true, one might expect to find that people spend money at a higher rate during a period of time that immediately follows from when they are paid.[^billsExcluded]\n\n[^billsExcluded]: One may or may not want to exclude a person's scheduled monthly expenses (\"bills\") from deriving the rate of spending. You may wish to exclude bills if you assume that the person has rationally accounted for the expenses, which may mean that the expenses would be unaffected by the increase in fund gain rate, or include bills if not.\n\nI think that the time that people, who are paid only once per month, are paid is an event quite unlike the rest of their month because during that time they see themselves gain a significantly larger amount of money in return for their usual amount of labor per day worked[^comeIntoWorkAnyway]. Following from this, I am concerned that people may wrongly come to feel (not deliberately think) that they will gain far more money for their usual amount of labor per day worked, or that they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do. People might think such by incorrectly dividing the funds gained, through their paycheck, by merely the amount of labor that they had to give on that specific day in order to receive it, instead of the amount of labor that they had to give during the period over which they were not paid.\n\n[^comeIntoWorkAnyway]: Assuming that they are paid during a day that they are working, or are not forced to collect their paycheck on a day they aren't working.\n\n\tThe issue of one feeling like they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do might be worse in cases where one isn't working on the day that they receive their paycheck,\nas `(money gained)/(labor given on that day)` is even less.\n\nIf this was found to be the case, I suspect that the rate of money spent (fund loss rate) would decrease[^feelingsFade] during a certain time period (the period during which one is still affected by the sudden gaining of money) until it reaches a common rate (when one may be said to be no longer affected). While one is still affected by the feeling that they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do, however, they will likely spend money at a higher rate, or have a higher fund loss rate.\n\n[^feelingsFade]: Because feelings fade, and the worker may slowly wake up to the reality of how much money they actually make per day.\n\nThe world's economy may be helped by the monthly or bi-weekly boosts in fund loss rates per worker, through their increased consumption, but I suspect that the worker ultimately suffers as a result of this[^lessMoneyMoreWork]. However, while monthly or bi-weekly payments may have been efficient in the past, when accounting and payroll was done by hand, those tasks may soon be able to be automated, thereby enabling workers to be paid daily, if not hourly. Increased payment frequency per month and decreased payment periods might lead workers to not feel the effect that I have suggested above, if there is such an effect.\n\n[^lessMoneyMoreWork]: Assuming that due to my proposed effect of the monthly or bi-weekly payments, a worker spends more money, which they earn through working, than they otherwise would, thereby leading them to work more to recoup the money they spent (assuming that they would wish to recoup that amount to attain some ultimately desired level of income).\n\nHowever, I am concerned about the possibility that if the payment frequency per month increases and payment periods decreases, workers will become greater workaholics than they currently are. I say this while envisioning a future where workers are no longer anxious about the prospect of working a whole 'nother month to receive a paycheck but are unwittingly obsessed with the thought of working just one more day for just one more dollar.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T20:03:41.634635931Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Financial-budgeting":{"title":"Financial budgeting","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T20:03:41.634635931Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Homelessness":{"title":"Homelessness","content":"\nSee [[notes/Houselessness|Houselessness]].","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T20:03:41.634635931Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Homemaking":{"title":"Homemaking","content":"\nHomemaking: building and maintaining a sense of home with yourself and your partner.

Not all tricks get recorded, and, so long as trick attempts aren't selectively recorded, that's OK.\n\n## Data Viz\n- Add a column for prior probability (treat blank odds as null), average this by Trick and/time periods, convert average to nearest 1/N and get the fraction for this - use the numerator and the denominator to get `a` and `b` for the beta dist from `a = numerator` and `b = denominator - numerator` - and plug those into the beta function to produce the posterior dist (we can aggregate the outcomes to make the `a` and `b` values)\n- A good reference for working with Beta dist in R; use the ggplot2 geom_density with the function dbeta to show perfect functions on a single time period (though you could facet on time periods and have it stack vertically) — for the ridge plots it will have to use rbeta, which randomly samples from the beta dist and generates a lumpy distribution unless you have a high sample rate https://www.causact.com/the-beta-distribution.html\n- A good general reference for the various beta functions: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compute-beta-distribution-in-r-programming-dbeta-pbeta-qbeta-and-rbeta-functions/\n\n- [ ] Ridge plot for skating distributions https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/elegant-visualization-of-density-distribution-in-r-using-ridgeline/\n\t- [ ] The Y value is the value to split the distributions by (across different lines, like the group value in regular plots), while the X value contains the probability readings that we took when sampling from each distribution\n\t- [ ] look into how to group dates by week / month\n\t\t- [ ] how might you fill in lines for weeks / months that are missing (gaps in the data)?\n\t- [ ] For each week/time period, produce an rbeta set of data points and append them to a variable (dataset) with the relevant values as metadata (trick name, time period)\n\t- [ ] Group by Trick, then Date (Week/Month)\n\t\t- [ ] Reformat date as Week, with `lubridate`: https://community.rstudio.com/t/visualize-by-week-number-and-year/9248/4\n\t- [ ] Facet wrap on Trick to see ridge plots side by side for each trick\n\t- [ ] http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html\n- Gallery: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html\n\t- The second dist on each layer seems to be determined when you set an aesthetic property equal to the variable that you want to split out\n\t\t- the dist data would need to be in the same x variable for all instances we'd want to break into separate dists; we just keep track of which one it is via another variable, like Political Party\n\n## Metadata\n[[projects/skate-stats/_index|Skate Stats]]: trick modifiers like Fakie, Switch, and 360. Fakie and Switch are mutually exclusive, but Fakie and 360 are not. At the basic level, adding these modifiers can be like assigning qualities to a beer in Untappd.\n- People that are interested in what is essential to do this and to do it themselves.\n- Runs are a string of tricks. FS 5050, FS 180 out = FS 5050 followed by a FS 180 off of a grind object (ledge, rail, bench - categories of things that have a weight-bearing platform (bench or ledge) or do not have them (rail, chain)).\n\t- Sessions are a set of tricks (and runs, which are themselves sets of tricks) that are usually restricted to a certain time frame, location, and obstacle or set of obstacles.\n\t\t- To what degree is the flat ground an obstacle? I guess it is since we tend to talk about \"flatground\" tricks, but often enough I've thought about it as the default position, a baseline against which all else is compared, a 0 to all others' -1 or +1.\n\t\t- Can one \"use\" the (flat)ground? I imagine that within a run you could jump from one ledge to the ground and use it in some determined way before jumping onto the next ledge. Very stylistic and betraying a thought process, a presence of decisions and determination.\n- Most people likely wouldn't be interested in the theory behind the project, and that's ok, but it's sort of a key motivator for me.\n- [ ] A way to save an attempt and then quickly fill out another attempt for the same trick (maybe have it default to the same odds, but allow them to be edited).\n- [ ] Interface to retroactively assign formal names to tricks, as doing so in the moment is slow and tedious.\n- [ ] Ridgeline plots\n\n\n## compared to other offerings\nThe app for the Fitbit for Skateboards: competitive inclination\n\n## Possible features\n- Bets (Success \u0026 Fail, which are the odds in favor)\n- Direct Probability estimates (instead of via Bets)\n- outcome\n\n## Research Directions\nTest whether Bets or Direct Probability (I no longer remember what I meant by this latter term; was it a relabelling of the first term, Bets, or something different?) surveys provide more accurate estimates of [[Trick Success Probability]].\n\nhttps://www.causact.com/the-beta-distribution.html\n\nFor the priors,\nTest whether averaging a trick's `a` and `b` values and then directly plugging those into the Beta dist functions seems more accurate than the process of converting each record to a probability, averaging that, then turning it into N-based a and b values that get plugged in to the beta dist function.\n\nLook at how bets tend to move slowly from an initial bet (initial bet being like 1/3 and only gradually moving to more confidence like 2/3). Figure out what one should expect. (This is a bit more noticable when there's been a gap in entries --- due to either not recording at all and/or not doing that trick (either could cause this if one hasn't been thinking in terms of the priors for a trick while skating and not recording (not recording would prompt one to think of the priors/bets) or by not doing the trick in a while one's confidence positively or negatively might have disappeared (in terms of the steepness of their prior dist, their degree of confidence))).","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T20:03:41.638635992Z","tags":[]}}
