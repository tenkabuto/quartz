Taleb would no doubt ask me, worriedly, \"are you deaf?\", if I did not state that the lead aphorism isn't necessarily true, as his whole investment strategy, as he outlined it in _Fooled_, ran quite contrary to it.\n\nI have thought about such primarily with regards to the fact that most people are, currently, paid only once or twice a month. If, in addition to this, the possibility that I suggested in the previous paragraph was true, one might expect to find that people spend money at a higher rate during a period of time that immediately follows from when they are paid.[^billsExcluded]\n\n[^billsExcluded]: One may or may not want to exclude a person's scheduled monthly expenses (\"bills\") from deriving the rate of spending. You may wish to exclude bills if you assume that the person has rationally accounted for the expenses, which may mean that the expenses would be unaffected by the increase in fund gain rate, or include bills if not.\n\nI think that the time that people, who are paid only once per month, are paid is an event quite unlike the rest of their month because during that time they see themselves gain a significantly larger amount of money in return for their usual amount of labor per day worked[^comeIntoWorkAnyway]. Following from this, I am concerned that people may wrongly come to feel (not deliberately think) that they will gain far more money for their usual amount of labor per day worked, or that they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do. People might think such by incorrectly dividing the funds gained, through their paycheck, by merely the amount of labor that they had to give on that specific day in order to receive it, instead of the amount of labor that they had to give during the period over which they were not paid.\n\n[^comeIntoWorkAnyway]: Assuming that they are paid during a day that they are working, or are not forced to collect their paycheck on a day they aren't working.\n\n\tThe issue of one feeling like they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do might be worse in cases where one isn't working on the day that they receive their paycheck,\nas `(money gained)/(labor given on that day)` is even less.\n\nIf this was found to be the case, I suspect that the rate of money spent (fund loss rate) would decrease[^feelingsFade] during a certain time period (the period during which one is still affected by the sudden gaining of money) until it reaches a common rate (when one may be said to be no longer affected). While one is still affected by the feeling that they have a higher fund gain rate than they actually do, however, they will likely spend money at a higher rate, or have a higher fund loss rate.\n\n[^feelingsFade]: Because feelings fade, and the worker may slowly wake up to the reality of how much money they actually make per day.\n\nThe world's economy may be helped by the monthly or bi-weekly boosts in fund loss rates per worker, through their increased consumption, but I suspect that the worker ultimately suffers as a result of this[^lessMoneyMoreWork]. However, while monthly or bi-weekly payments may have been efficient in the past, when accounting and payroll was done by hand, those tasks may soon be able to be automated, thereby enabling workers to be paid daily, if not hourly. Increased payment frequency per month and decreased payment periods might lead workers to not feel the effect that I have suggested above, if there is such an effect.\n\n[^lessMoneyMoreWork]: Assuming that due to my proposed effect of the monthly or bi-weekly payments, a worker spends more money, which they earn through working, than they otherwise would, thereby leading them to work more to recoup the money they spent (assuming that they would wish to recoup that amount to attain some ultimately desired level of income).\n\nHowever, I am concerned about the possibility that if the payment frequency per month increases and payment periods decreases, workers will become greater workaholics than they currently are. I say this while envisioning a future where workers are no longer anxious about the prospect of working a whole 'nother month to receive a paycheck but are unwittingly obsessed with the thought of working just one more day for just one more dollar.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-10T04:32:17.711578753Z","tags":[]},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-10T04:32:17.711578753Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-10T04:32:17.715578824Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

Progression (or regression), visualized!\n\n# Current Status\nDisorganized: Lots of disparate notes that need to be compiled and ironed out, some code and visuals\n\nCould likely benefit from compiling everything in one place and being more structured in how it's presented or different concerns are sufficiently separated out\n\n# History\nOriginally I was interested in how you might be able to bet on and against yourself as a way of estimating the probability of doing a trick. (So the prior data came first.) I got this idea while reading *Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way*, which showed me how similar data can be used to estimate probabilities.\n\nI started to collect the Outcome data after I realized that I'd want to be able to check the accuracy of my bets against data that was kinda more real/less open to interpretation (especially as my understanding of this domain of statistics was so shaky).\n\n---\n\nOne thing to remember when analyzing this data is always that the analyses pertain to the tricks that have been recorded. Not all tricks get recorded, and, so long as trick attempts aren't selectively recorded, that's OK.\n\n# Data Viz\n- Add a column for prior probability (treat blank odds as null), average this by Trick and/time periods, convert average to nearest 1/N and get the fraction for this - use the numerator and the denominator to get `a` and `b` for the beta dist from `a = numerator` and `b = denominator - numerator` - and plug those into the beta function to produce the posterior dist (we can aggregate the outcomes to make the `a` and `b` values)\n- A good reference for working with Beta dist in R; use the ggplot2 geom_density with the function dbeta to show perfect functions on a single time period (though you could facet on time periods and have it stack vertically) — for the ridge plots it will have to use rbeta, which randomly samples from the beta dist and generates a lumpy distribution unless you have a high sample rate https://www.causact.com/the-beta-distribution.html\n- A good general reference for the various beta functions: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compute-beta-distribution-in-r-programming-dbeta-pbeta-qbeta-and-rbeta-functions/\n\n- [ ] Ridge plot for skating distributions https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/elegant-visualization-of-density-distribution-in-r-using-ridgeline/\n\t- [ ] The Y value is the value to split the distributions by (across different lines, like the group value in regular plots), while the X value contains the probability readings that we took when sampling from each distribution\n\t- [ ] look into how to group dates by week / month\n\t\t- [ ] how might you fill in lines for weeks / months that are missing (gaps in the data)?\n\t- [ ] For each week/time period, produce an rbeta set of data points and append them to a variable (dataset) with the relevant values as metadata (trick name, time period)\n\t- [ ] Group by Trick, then Date (Week/Month)\n\t\t- [ ] Reformat date as Week, with `lubridate`: https://community.rstudio.com/t/visualize-by-week-number-and-year/9248/4\n\t- [ ] Facet wrap on Trick to see ridge plots side by side for each trick\n\t- [ ] http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html\n- Gallery: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html\n\t- The second dist on each layer seems to be determined when you set an aesthetic property equal to the variable that you want to split out\n\t\t- the dist data would need to be in the same x variable for all instances we'd want to break into separate dists; we just keep track of which one it is via another variable, like Political Party\n\n# Metadata\n[[projects/skate-stats/_index|Skate Stats]]: trick modifiers like Fakie, Switch, and 360. Fakie and Switch are mutually exclusive, but Fakie and 360 are not. At the basic level, adding these modifiers can be like assigning qualities to a beer in Untappd.\n- People that are interested in what is essential to do this and to do it themselves.\n- Runs are a string of tricks. FS 5050, FS 180 out = FS 5050 followed by a FS 180 off of a grind object (ledge, rail, bench - categories of things that have a weight-bearing platform (bench or ledge) or do not have them (rail, chain)).\n\t- Sessions are a set of tricks (and runs, which are themselves sets of tricks) that are usually restricted to a certain time frame, location, and obstacle or set of obstacles.\n\t\t- To what degree is the flat ground an obstacle? I guess it is since we tend to talk about \"flatground\" tricks, but often enough I've thought about it as the default position, a baseline against which all else is compared, a 0 to all others' -1 or +1.\n\t\t- Can one \"use\" the (flat)ground? I imagine that within a run you could jump from one ledge to the ground and use it in some determined way before jumping onto the next ledge. Very stylistic and betraying a thought process, a presence of decisions and determination.\n- Most people likely wouldn't be interested in the theory behind the project, and that's ok, but it's sort of a key motivator for me.\n- [ ] A way to save an attempt and then quickly fill out another attempt for the same trick (maybe have it default to the same odds, but allow them to be edited).\n- [ ] Interface to retroactively assign formal names to tricks, as doing so in the moment is slow and tedious.\n- [ ] Ridgeline plots\n\n\n# compared to other offerings\nThe app for the Fitbit for Skateboards: competitive inclination\n\n# Possible features\n- Bets (Success \u0026 Fail, which are the odds in favor)\n- Direct Probability estimates (instead of via Bets)\n- outcome\n\n# Research Directions\nTest whether Bets or Direct Probability (I no longer remember what I meant by this latter term; was it a relabelling of the first term, Bets, or something different?) surveys provide more accurate estimates of [[Trick Success Probability]].\n\nhttps://www.causact.com/the-beta-distribution.html\n\nFor the priors,\nTest whether averaging a trick's `a` and `b` values and then directly plugging those into the Beta dist functions seems more accurate than the process of converting each record to a probability, averaging that, then turning it into N-based a and b values that get plugged in to the beta dist function.\n\nLook at how bets tend to move slowly from an initial bet (initial bet being like 1/3 and only gradually moving to more confidence like 2/3). Figure out what one should expect. (This is a bit more noticable when there's been a gap in entries --- due to either not recording at all and/or not doing that trick (either could cause this if one hasn't been thinking in terms of the priors for a trick while skating and not recording (not recording would prompt one to think of the priors/bets) or by not doing the trick in a while one's confidence positively or negatively might have disappeared (in terms of the steepness of their prior dist, their degree of confidence))).","lastmodified":"2023-07-10T04:32:17.715578824Z","tags":[]}}
